        <p class="lead" id="ptext">Ardith Mae Farm was started in January 2006 in Northeastern Pennsylvania. In February of 2013, we decided to leave PA and moved to a farm in Columbia County, NY. After leasing for 10 years, in the fall of 2022 we were finally able to purchase our own farm, which was just a few miles away.               

        One of our main goals is to allow our animals to be animals. We make sure the goats are able to climb, explore and sample as many types of forage as possible. Our rotational grazing/browsing system provides the goats with their needed forage and exercise while also improving their soil and vegetation. Ardith Mae established an every-other-year breeding program which alleviates the health stress of a yearly pregnancy and increases the longevity of the herd. The goats are fed organic and Non-GMO grains, never given hormones or unnecessary antibiotics. Ardith Mae Farm has been an Animal Welfare Approved dairy for 11 years.                                                                             
        
        Here we milk a herd of 60 goofy and rambunctious Saanen, LaMancha, and Alpine goats.  With their lovely milk, we make a variety of French style cheeses that are carefully hand crafted from beginning to end.
